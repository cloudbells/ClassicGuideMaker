- should have a separate config GUI
- if player completes a quest but hasnt handed it in yet, mark it yellow(?)
- if player delivers quest or has delivered the quest, mark it green (forever - check via API if its completed or not for each step and color it on guide load)
- if player fails a quest, mark it red
- if player picks up a quest, mark it blue
- if quest is unavailable due to level or uncompleted prerequisite or any other reason (can this be checked via API?), mark it gray
- should add pins to the map which show step number (black border, white background), arrow should point to 1 always

arrow:
- it should guide the player to coordinates of the current step

functionality:
- needs to be adaptable to potential future changes in the quest system
- should auto accept quests that are part of the current guide
- if player accepts or completes or delivers a quest that is before or after the current step, mark those as done anyway

config:
- should be able to lock the position and size of the addon
- should be able to set font size (default: 12?)
- should be able to set border size (default: 1)
- all config options should be editable via commands

guide dev UI (activatable via checkbox in config):
- there should be a button at the bottom of the step list that adds a new step, which should include:
    - checkbox for substep (is this step 3.1 or 4?)
    - step number (non-editable)
    - step description (required, text editable)
    - step type - accept quest, do quest (display quest progress in guide in real time - 4/10 tigers killed), deliver quest, grind until XP, die (spirit ress), coordinate trigger, and more(?)
    - quest ID (required if type is accept, do, or deliver, number editable - option to link to wowhead?) - check that its a real quest via in game API
    - coordinates (optional editable) - button to set this editable to the player's current coordinates
- right clicking a step allows player to delete, edit, or add new step after the clicked step
        
        
        step conditional? if level x, skip?
        
each step is directly saved to saved variables and at each step the player is given the option (button?) to export the current guide via copy-paste
    - needs directions to show player how its imported/exported
